## Selected Concepts

---

### Concept 1: Cheaper Than Therapy
- **Type:** Humor / Big Benefit Statement
- **Score:** 24/25 (Emotional: 5, Scroll-Stop: 5, Brand: 4, Differentiation: 5, Feasibility: 5)
- **Funnel Stage:** Conversion
- **Strategic Rationale:** Research shows customers literally describe pottery as "cheaper than therapy" in reviews — using their own language as the headline creates instant recognition and humor that interrupts the scroll. This angle is uncontested in the mini pottery wheel category.
- **Ad Copy:** "CHEAPER THAN THERAPY." (large headline) / "Science-backed stress relief. Shipped to your door." / "4.9 ★  |  400+ Reviews"
- **File:** Concept1_Cheaper_Than_Therapy.png

**NanoBanana Prompt:**
Commercial product photography of a Table Clay Mini Pottery Wheel on a warm cream linen surface, with a small finished ring dish and mini bowl placed beside it, still showing clay fingerprints. The background is deep charcoal (#2D3436), creating dramatic contrast against the warm cream wheel body. The wheel is off to the right side of the frame, occupying the center-right 50% of the image below the headline text area. The pottery wheel is a compact tabletop electric model with a smooth, clean cream (#F5F0E8) body, a small splash tray at the base, and a raw off-white clay piece centered on the spinning wheel head. The wheel looks modern and artisan — not a toy, not an appliance. Beside it, two small hand-pinched pottery pieces — a ring dish and a tiny bowl — rest naturally on the surface, showing real beginner results with gentle clay fingerprints for authenticity. At the top 35% of the image, in massive bold condensed sans-serif text spanning 85% of the image width, cream white (#FFF8F0): "CHEAPER THAN THERAPY." Below that headline in lighter, smaller sans-serif, sage green (#B5C4A1): "Science-backed stress relief. Shipped to your door." At the very bottom center, small cream text: "4.9 ★  400+ Reviews". Soft warm directional light from the upper left, creating gentle highlights on the wheel rim and clay, with subtle shadows falling right and downward. Commercial lifestyle photography style, premium DTC brand aesthetic, editorial warmth. Slightly elevated camera angle, approximately 20 degrees above eye level. Medium depth of field — wheel and pots are sharp, background falls to smooth dark blur. Color palette: charcoal (#2D3436) background, cream (#F5F0E8) wheel, sage green text (#B5C4A1). Do not include: a handle on the wheel, glossy surfaces, bright plastic toy colors, kiln equipment, a large industrial wheel, uncontrolled clay splatter, distorted or misspelled text, straw-like tools in background, any food items. --ar 4:5

### Concept 2: Make Something Real
- **Type:** Big Benefit Statement / Lifestyle
- **Score:** 23/25 (Emotional: 5, Scroll-Stop: 5, Brand: 5, Differentiation: 4, Feasibility: 4)
- **Funnel Stage:** Awareness
- **Strategic Rationale:** The creative identity driver — "I make things with my hands" — is a core emotional need identified in research. This concept leads with a visually hypnotic overhead shot of clay being actively thrown on the spinning wheel, with motion blur creating a mesmerizing, scroll-stopping image. Minimal text keeps the visual pure.
- **Ad Copy:** "MAKE SOMETHING REAL." (bold, top) / "Table Clay" (small wordmark, bottom right)
- **File:** Concept2_Make_Something_Real.png

**NanoBanana Prompt:**
Commercial product photography, slightly overhead angle at approximately 35 degrees, of a compact electric pottery wheel in active use — fresh off-white clay actively being centered and shaped on the spinning wheel head, creating a beautiful circular motion-blur effect around the edges of the spinning clay. The wheel body is warm cream (#F5F0E8), compact and clean, not a toy. Two hands — dusted lightly in white clay — frame the clay on the left and right sides, barely visible at the outer edges of the frame, adding authenticity without dominating the composition. The clay is the hero: it occupies the center 60% of the frame, with the warm terracotta-toned clay slightly glistening from water used in throwing. The background is deep charcoal (#2D3436). A small amount of terracotta-tinted clay water pools naturally around the wheel head — organic and real, not messy. Warm directional studio lighting from slightly above and left, creating soft golden highlights on the spinning clay center. Slight motion blur on the outer rim of the spinning clay for visual dynamism, sharp focus on the raised clay center peak. At the very top of the image, in bold condensed sans-serif, cream white (#FFF8F0), spanning 75% of the image width: "MAKE SOMETHING REAL." At the very bottom right, in small light sans-serif, sage green (#B5C4A1): "Table Clay". Premium DTC brand aesthetic, editorial warmth, slightly moody. Color palette: deep charcoal background, cream wheel body, warm clay tones, minimal sage green text. Do not include: toy-like plastic colors, a large industrial wheel size, kiln equipment, screw-on lids or extraneous attachments, handles on the wheel, unrecognizable blurry mush instead of centered clay, distorted text, multiple wheels, children or adult faces. --ar 4:5

### Concept 3: Made By Me
- **Type:** UGC-Style / Testimonial
- **Score:** 22/25 (Emotional: 5, Scroll-Stop: 4, Brand: 5, Differentiation: 4, Feasibility: 4)
- **Funnel Stage:** Consideration
- **Strategic Rationale:** Pride and accomplishment for beginners is the #1 emotional payoff from research — "I made this and I'm proud of it." The clay-dusted hands holding a small finished piece communicates real results by a real beginner. This feels like a customer's Instagram post, which builds authenticity and trust.
- **Ad Copy:** "MADE BY ME." (bold, top) / "Day 1. No class. Just Table Clay." (smaller, below)
- **File:** Concept3_Made_By_Me.png

**NanoBanana Prompt:**
Close-up lifestyle photography of two hands — dusted lightly with dry white clay, showing real use — gently cradling a small, freshly made pottery piece: a delicate little ring dish, slightly imperfect at the rim in an endearing way, showing the natural texture of air-dry clay. The hands are centered in the lower 60% of the frame, holding the dish at a slight tilt toward camera so it's fully visible. The ring dish is approximately 3–4 inches in diameter, round, shallow, with a gentle indentation center — natural off-white clay with a soft matte surface, not painted or glazed. The background is softly blurred: a warm cream (#F5F0E8) wooden tabletop surface with the edge of the mini pottery wheel just barely visible, cream and sage green tones, all out of focus. Warm, natural window light from the right side, casting a gentle soft shadow on the left side of the hands. The mood is personal, proud, quiet — feels like a real person's first creation. At the top 30% of the image, in bold condensed sans-serif, charcoal (#2D3436): "MADE BY ME." Below in smaller, lighter sans-serif, terracotta (#C4826A): "Day 1. No class. Just Table Clay." UGC-style lifestyle photography, authentic imperfection, warm and personal editorial feeling. Slightly elevated angle at 20 degrees. Shallow depth of field — hands and ring dish are tack-sharp, background blurs beautifully. Color palette: off-white clay, warm skin tones, cream (#F5F0E8) background blur, charcoal text, terracotta subtitle. Do not include: perfectly manicured or un-dusted hands, factory-made smooth ceramic product, handles on the pottery, kiln equipment, painted/glazed pottery pieces, multiple products in background, distorted text, children's toy aesthetic. --ar 4:5

### Concept 4: Date Night Upgrade
- **Type:** Lifestyle / Aspirational
- **Score:** 22/25 (Emotional: 5, Scroll-Stop: 5, Brand: 4, Differentiation: 5, Feasibility: 3)
- **Funnel Stage:** Awareness
- **Strategic Rationale:** The couples bonding angle is explicitly cited in research as a top motivator — customers describe it as "the best date night activity." No pottery wheel brand currently leads with this angle. The visual of two sets of hands working clay together is intimate, mesmerizing, and uniquely scroll-stopping.
- **Ad Copy:** "DATE NIGHT UPGRADE." (bold headline, top) / "Ditch the reservation. Make something together." (smaller, below headline)
- **File:** Concept4_Date_Night_Upgrade.png

**NanoBanana Prompt:**
Warm, intimate lifestyle photography of two pairs of hands — one slightly larger, one smaller — both dusted with soft white clay, simultaneously working a small lump of off-white clay on a compact electric pottery wheel. The wheel is cream (#F5F0E8), small and modern, centered in the lower 55% of the frame. The clay on the spinning wheel is a soft off-white mound, slightly raised in the center, both sets of hands gently shaping it from opposite sides in a classic pottery-style pose. The setting is a cozy evening dining table or kitchen table, with warm candlelight visible softly blurred in the background — two small candle flames and a glass of red wine at the far edges of frame, very soft focus. The background overall is a deep warm terracotta-tinged charcoal (#2D3436). Warm golden evening light from candles creates a soft, intimate glow across the hands and clay — golden highlights on the tops of hands, gentle shadow underneath. At the top 30% of the image, bold condensed sans-serif, cream white (#FFF8F0): "DATE NIGHT UPGRADE." Below in smaller light sans-serif, sage green (#B5C4A1): "Ditch the reservation. Make something together." Premium lifestyle photography, romantic editorial warmth, DTC brand aesthetic. Slightly elevated camera angle, 20 degrees above level. Shallow depth of field — hands and wheel sharp, background candles and wine glass extremely soft. Color palette: charcoal/terracotta background, cream wheel, warm skin tones, golden candlelight, cream and sage green text. Do not include: toy-like plastic colors on wheel, large industrial pottery wheel, kiln equipment, more than 2 people, visible faces, messy uncontrolled clay splatter, distorted or misspelled text, metallic surfaces. --ar 4:5

### Concept 5: Every Single Thing Included
- **Type:** Features & Benefits / Unboxing
- **Score:** 21/25 (Emotional: 4, Scroll-Stop: 4, Brand: 5, Differentiation: 3, Feasibility: 5)
- **Funnel Stage:** Conversion
- **Strategic Rationale:** Objection research shows "is everything really included?" as a top anxiety — will I need to buy things separately? This editorial flatlay answers that definitively with a satisfying organized display of everything in the bundle. The visual abundance and organization triggers both desire and trust.
- **Ad Copy:** "EVERY. SINGLE. THING. INCLUDED." (bold, top) / "Wheel + 2lbs Clay + 16 Tools + Paints" (smaller, bottom)
- **File:** Concept5_Everything_Included.png

**NanoBanana Prompt:**
Editorial overhead flatlay product photography of the complete Table Clay Mini Pottery Wheel Starter Bundle contents, beautifully arranged on a warm cream (#F5F0E8) linen fabric surface. The compact cream electric pottery wheel sits centrally, slightly left of center, as the hero piece. Radiating outward in an organized, intentional arrangement: two sealed packs of natural off-white air-dry clay (each labeled with weight), 16 pottery tools fanned neatly in two arcs — thin metal-tipped sculpting tools and small wooden shaping tools — a small tray with 8 paints in earth tones and a set of fine brushes, a folded instruction booklet, and a small finished example piece: a tiny ring dish showing what you can make. A small tray of water adds authenticity. The arrangement is editorial — like a magazine product spread — clean, purposeful, slightly artistic. All items clearly identifiable. The background is the warm cream linen. Soft diffused overhead studio lighting, even and bright, no harsh shadows, slightly warm color temperature to make the cream and natural tones glow. Camera directly overhead (flat-lay, 90 degrees), even depth of field — everything sharp across the frame. Color palette: warm cream linen (#F5F0E8), natural clay tones, sage green (#B5C4A1) accent elements, deep charcoal (#2D3436) tool handles. At the top 25% of the image, in bold condensed dark sans-serif (charcoal, #2D3436): "EVERY. SINGLE. THING. INCLUDED." At the bottom center, in small light sans-serif, terracotta (#C4826A): "Wheel + 2lbs Clay + 16 Tools + Paints". Premium DTC editorial flatlay photography, warm and organized aesthetic. Do not include: random clutter, tools scattered messily, any non-pottery items, toy-like objects, bright plastic colors, missing any bundle components, distorted or misspelled text. --ar 4:5
