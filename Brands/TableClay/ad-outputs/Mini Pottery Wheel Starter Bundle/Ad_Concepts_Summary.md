## Selected Concepts — Top 5

### Concept 1: The Calming Escape
- Type: Lifestyle/Aspirational
- Score: 23/25

### Concept 2: Oddly Satisfying
- Type: Big Benefit Statement
- Score: 22/25
- Funnel Stage: Awareness
- Strategic Rationale: "Oddly satisfying" viral pottery content is a major awareness and impulse purchase driver. No competitor leans into the ASMR/sensory angle in static ads.

### Concept 3: Testimonial — Review Pull
- Type: Testimonial/Review
- Score: 21/25
- Funnel Stage: Conversion
- Strategic Rationale: Customer quotes mirror the exact emotional language of the target persona. Review-style testimonial ads are proven conversion drivers, and no pottery kit competitor runs this format.
- Ad Copy: "My calming escape after work." / — Verified Buyer / 4.9 Stars - 200+ Reviews
- File: Concept3_Testimonial_Review.png
- Gemini: https://gemini.google.com/app/08fe0d9c2100ca1f

### Concept 4: Pain Agitation — Screen Time
- Type: Pain Agitation
- Score: 21/25
- Funnel Stage: Consideration
- Strategic Rationale: Screen time anxiety is the #1 pain point for parents. No pottery kit competitor runs anti-screen-time messaging.
- Ad Copy: LEFT: "Another hour on screens?" / RIGHT: "Or making something real?" / BOTTOM: "GIVE THEM THE WHEEL." / "No screens. No limits. Just clay."

### Concept 5: Gift Unboxing
- Type: Unboxing/Gift
- Score: 20/25
- Funnel Stage: Consideration/Conversion
- Strategic Rationale: Gift buyers are a major persona. Pottery kits are "experience gifts" more thoughtful than gadgets. No competitor emphasizes premium gift presentation.
- Ad Copy: "GIVE THE JOY OF MAKING." / "The experience gift they'll never forget." / Badge: "Everything Included"
