Generated: February 18, 2026

## Selected Concepts (Top 5)

### Concept 1: Peace of Mind, Gift-Wrapped
- **Type:** Gift Angle | **Score:** 23/25
- **Strategic Rationale:** Peace of mind is the #1 purchase driver (60%+ of reviews). PrepPack uniquely owns the gifting-emotion space — no competitor positions around "you care about them."
- **Ad Copy:** "PEACE OF MIND. GIFT-WRAPPED." / "100+ essentials. One box."

**NanoBanana Prompt:**
Commercial product photography of The Original PrepPack box placed elegantly on a warm honey-toned wooden surface, styled as a premium gift. The PrepPack is a clean, matte navy blue rectangular box approximately 12 inches wide and 8 inches tall with "PrepPack" printed prominently in crisp white lettering on the front face. The box has a premium matte finish, not glossy, with clean modern typography. A handwritten gift tag reading "For you" is tied to the box with a neutral linen ribbon looped around the top. In the soft-focus background, warm bokeh from string lights suggests a celebratory occasion — college graduation or move-in day. The surface is natural light oak wood grain. The atmosphere is warm, tender, and hopeful — the emotion of sending a child off to college and wanting them to be safe. Soft warm directional lighting from the upper left creates gentle highlights on the box edge and ribbon, with soft natural shadows falling to the right. Camera angle is slightly elevated (20 degrees above eye level), product centered in the left 55% of the frame. Medium depth of field — the box is tack-sharp, background falls to smooth warm blur. At the top 22% of the image, large bold condensed sans-serif text reads "PEACE OF MIND. GIFT-WRAPPED." in cream white spanning 80% of image width. At the bottom 12%, smaller sans-serif text reads "100+ essentials. One box." in cream white. Color palette: navy blue box (#1B3A6B), warm honey wood (#C8966C), deep warm dark background (#2C1810), cream text (#FFF8F0), warm string light bokeh (#E8A84C). Do not include: multiple boxes, wrapping paper obscuring the product, generic holiday decorations, glossy box finish, excessive props that distract from the hero product, distorted or misspelled text, military or camping aesthetic. --ar 4:5

### Concept 2: The 2 AM Nightmare
- **Type:** Pain Agitation | **Score:** 22/25
- **Strategic Rationale:** The "2 AM sick scenario" is the single most vivid and universally cited use case in the research — campus health closed, no pharmacy accessible, student alone and sick. PrepPack's foundational fear-to-relief arc.
- **Ad Copy:** "2 AM. SICK. NO PHARMACY NEARBY." / "PrepPack changes that."
- **File:** Concept2_The2AMNightmare.png

**NanoBanana Prompt:**
A split-screen static image ad divided by a clean vertical line down the center. Left half: a dark, cold, blue-tinged dorm room at 2 AM. A college student in a hoodie sits hunched on a bed, illuminated only by the cold blue-white glow of a phone screen held in their hands. The phone shows a text conversation. The mood is anxious, isolated, hopeless. The left side palette is desaturated and cold — cool grays and muted blues (#1A2340, #2D3A5C). Right half: the same dorm room but now bathed in warm, reassuring amber-golden light. The student sits upright at their desk, confidently and calmly opening a matte navy blue PrepPack box labeled "PrepPack" in white text. Several items are partially visible as they open it — a small medication packet, a digital thermometer. The right side palette is warm and relieved — amber (#D4873C), soft warm white (#FFF8F0). A thin clean white vertical dividing line separates the two halves. At the very top of the image spanning full width, large bold condensed sans-serif text reads "2 AM. SICK. NO PHARMACY NEARBY." in white. In the bottom 15% of the right half only, smaller cream text reads "PrepPack changes that." Commercial editorial photography style. Camera angle slightly above eye level. Medium depth of field. Color palette: left cold blue-gray (#1A2340), right warm amber (#D4873C), white divider line, cream text (#FFF8F0). Do not include: graphic illness imagery, clearly identifiable faces with specific expressions, stock photo aesthetic, distorted or misspelled text, product that looks like a medicine bag or first aid kit with a red cross. --ar 4:5

### Concept 3: Dorm Floor Hero
- **Type:** Lifestyle / Aspirational | **Score:** 22/25
- **Strategic Rationale:** The "Dorm Hero" social currency motivation is the 3rd-ranked purchase driver. Students with well-stocked kits become trusted resources on their floor, building community. No competitor targets this angle.
- **Ad Copy:** "BE THE HERO OF YOUR FLOOR." / "First aid. Tools. Safety. Comfort."
- **File:** Concept3_DormFloorHero.png

**NanoBanana Prompt:**
Warm commercial lifestyle photography of a college-aged student standing in an open dorm room doorway, confidently holding an open matte navy blue PrepPack box (approximately 12 inches wide, labeled "PrepPack" in white lettering on the front) at waist level. The student's energy is warm, confident, and welcoming. Through the open doorway, two hallmates in casual clothes are visible in the warm-lit dormitory corridor beyond — one reaching toward the box gratefully. The hallway shows classic dormitory architecture — painted cinder block walls, institutional doors, warm Edison bulb ceiling lighting creating a golden amber glow (#E8A84C). The atmosphere conveys social connection, competence, and belonging. Items from the PrepPack are partially visible inside the open box: a bandage package, a small packet of medications, a small flashlight. Soft warm directional light from inside the dorm room illuminates the hero student from behind and to the left, creating a gentle rim light. At the top 22% of the image, bold condensed sans-serif text reads "BE THE HERO OF YOUR FLOOR." in cream white (#FFF8F0). At the bottom 15%, smaller light sans-serif reads "First aid. Tools. Safety. Comfort." in cream white. Camera angle slightly elevated (15 degrees above eye level), hero student center-frame. Medium-shallow depth of field — hero student and box tack-sharp, hallway beyond falls to warm bokeh. Color palette: warm amber hallway (#E8A84C), navy PrepPack box (#1B3A6B), cream text (#FFF8F0). Do not include: clearly recognizable real faces, sad or depressing dormitory conditions, stock photo look, logos of other brands visible, distorted or misspelled text. --ar 4:5

### Concept 4: Safety Included
- **Type:** Big Benefit Statement | **Score:** 22/25
- **Strategic Rationale:** Campus safety is a deeply felt but rarely addressed parental anxiety. No competitor bundles a personal safety alarm as part of a comprehensive kit. This makes the invisible visible and directly exploits a competitive gap.
- **Ad Copy:** "SAFETY. INCLUDED." / "120dB alarm. Flashlight. Emergency blanket."
- **File:** Concept4_SafetyIncluded.png

**NanoBanana Prompt:**
Dramatic commercial product photography of a personal safety alarm — a small, compact keychain-style alarm approximately 2.5 inches long in matte navy blue (#1B3A6B) with a bright orange-red pull pin — resting in the open palm of a hand shown from mid-palm with fingers gently curved upward. The background is deep charcoal (#2D3436), nearly black, creating maximum contrast with the product. A single warm beam of golden studio light from the upper right creates a strong glowing highlight along the top edge of the alarm and rim lights the hand, separating both from the dark background. The lighting conveys the feeling of passing something precious and important to someone you love. The safety alarm has a clean, modern minimal design — no visible brand text on the device, just the pull-pin mechanism clearly visible. At the top 28% of the image, large bold condensed sans-serif text reads "SAFETY. INCLUDED." in cream white (#FFF8F0). Below in slightly smaller text: "Not sold separately. Just packed." At the bottom 15%, small light sans-serif reads "120dB alarm + flashlight + emergency blanket." in cream white. The hand and alarm are in the center-bottom 60% of the frame. Camera at near-eye level with 85mm portrait lens compression feel. Shallow depth of field — the alarm and hand are razor-sharp, the background falls to smooth dark gradient. Color palette: deep charcoal background (#2D3436), navy alarm (#1B3A6B), golden warm light (#D4873C), orange-red pull pin accent, cream text (#FFF8F0). Do not include: multiple products in the frame, visible brand logos other than described, AI-distorted hand anatomy, visible face, distorted or misspelled text. --ar 4:5

### Concept 5: Flat Lay Unboxing
- **Type:** Features & Benefits | **Score:** 21/25
- **Strategic Rationale:** "Can I see what's actually in it?" is a top research objection. Radical transparency (photograph every item) is PrepPack's stated strategy. A flat lay showing 100+ items organized by category is the most powerful answer to "it's just bandaids and aspirin" — directly targeting the value-perception gap.
- **Ad Copy:** "100+ ITEMS. 4 CATEGORIES. $100." / "Everything they need. Nothing they'll forget."
- **File:** Concept5_FlatLayUnboxing.png

**NanoBanana Prompt:**
Commercial overhead flat-lay product photography of The Original PrepPack's contents laid out in an organized, meticulous, visually satisfying arrangement on a deep navy blue matte surface (#0D1B2A). The navy blue PrepPack box — approximately 12 inches wide, matte finish, "PrepPack" in white lettering — sits at the top center of the composition as the hero anchor. Below and around the box, 30-40 individual items from the kit are arranged in four distinct quadrant groupings with breathing room between each piece. Upper-left quadrant: First Aid items — roll of bandages, small packet of OTC medications, a digital thermometer in its case, gauze pads, antiseptic wipes. Upper-right quadrant: Tools and Repairs — silver-black multitool closed, a small roll of duct tape, measuring tape in yellow, super glue tube, small scissors. Lower-left quadrant: Safety Essentials — navy safety alarm keychain with orange pull pin, compact black flashlight, folded silver emergency blanket. Lower-right quadrant: Comfort items — foam earplugs pair, sleep mask in navy, small electrolyte powder packets, mini deck of playing cards. Small cream label cards sit next to each quadrant. Even diffused studio lighting from directly overhead — every item crisp and identifiable with no harsh shadows. At the top 14% of the image, bold condensed sans-serif text reads "100+ ITEMS. 4 CATEGORIES. $100." in cream white (#FFF8F0). At the bottom 10%, smaller text: "Everything they need. Nothing they'll forget." Camera angle: perfectly overhead (90 degrees flat-lay). Deep depth of field — every item sharp edge-to-edge. Color palette: deep navy surface (#0D1B2A), navy box (#1B3A6B), cream labels (#FFF8F0). Do not include: items from outside a college preparedness kit, overlapping elements obscuring individual products, harsh directional shadows, glossy surface reflections, distorted or misspelled text, random clutter or decorative props. --ar 4:5
