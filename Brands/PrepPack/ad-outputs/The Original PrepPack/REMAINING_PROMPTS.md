## CONCEPT 1 — Filename: Concept1_Gift_That_Gets_Used.png
**Score: 23/25 | Type: Gift Angle**

Generate an image: Commercial product photography of a PrepPack college preparedness kit presented as a beautiful graduation gift on a warm cream-colored linen surface. The PrepPack box is a clean, premium white gift box with navy blue branding text and a tasteful gold ribbon tied around it. Beside the open box, approximately 15-20 key items are artfully arranged: a black multitool, a digital thermometer in its case, a compact silver personal safety alarm, a small folded mint-green fleece blanket, blister packs of Advil and cold medicine, a mini flashlight, a roll of duct tape, bandage packets, earplugs in a small container, and a deck of cards in a red case. The items radiate outward from the box in an organized arc, styled like a high-end gift editorial. The background is warm, soft, cream-ivory (#F9F3EC). The box itself is centered-left in the frame. At the top of the image, bold text in large modern condensed sans-serif: "NOT ANOTHER GIFT CARD." in deep navy blue (#1A2A4A), spanning 80% of the image width. Just below in smaller, lighter sans-serif: "The graduation gift they'll reach for every week." At the bottom-right, small badge text: "100+ items · $100". Soft, warm, directional lighting from the upper-left, creating gentle highlights on the ribbon bow and multitool, with subtle shadows falling right. Warm daylight color temperature. Eye level, slightly elevated camera angle (15 degrees). Medium depth of field — items and box sharp, background clean but soft. Premium DTC gift brand aesthetic, editorial styling, clean and aspirational. Color palette: cream background (#F9F3EC), navy text (#1A2A4A), warm gold ribbon accent (#C9A84C). Do not include: any visible brand logos of competitors, more than one box, excessive clutter, product that looks mass-produced or clinical, any gift bows that look cheap or plastic. --ar 4:5

## CONCEPT 2 — Filename: Concept2_2AM_Scenario.png
**Score: 22/25 | Type: Nightmare Scenario**

Generate an image: Dramatic lifestyle narrative image for a 4:5 vertical ad. The top 55% of the image shows a dark, atmospheric dorm room scene at 2 AM: a college student sitting on a bed in a dark room, phone illuminating their silhouette with cold blue-white glow, the phone screen showing the time 2:02 AM. The ambient room is deep dark navy-charcoal (#0D1B2A) with only the phone light and a faint yellow hallway glow under the door. No face is distinguishable — only a silhouetted figure holding a glowing phone. A narrow visual gradient band transitions from cold charcoal (top) to warm amber (bottom). The bottom 35% transitions to a warm, hopeful scene: the same dorm room nightstand showing a neatly organized PrepPack open box with warm desk lamp light (#F4A261 amber glow) — a digital thermometer, Advil blister pack, and electrolyte powder stick pack visible and organized. At the top of the image, bold condensed white sans-serif with a slight drop shadow: "2 AM. FEVER. HEALTH CENTER CLOSED." Below in slightly smaller warm-toned text: "PrepPack has them covered." Small bottom badge: "100+ items · $100". The dramatic contrast between cold blue isolation (top) and warm amber preparedness (bottom) creates the emotional before/after. Commercial narrative photography, cinematic quality, 4:5 vertical portrait. Do not include: full distinguishable face of any person, standard red cross first aid kit, clinical white plastic first aid boxes, hospital imagery, blood or injury imagery. --ar 4:5

## CONCEPT 3 — Filename: Concept3_Parent_Thankyou_Text.png
**Score: 22/25 | Type: Testimonial / Review**

Generate an image: Warm lifestyle product photography featuring a close-up of a parent's hands holding a smartphone, the phone screen showing a heartwarming text message thread. The phone screen displays a simple two-message exchange: an outgoing green bubble reading "Thinking of you - hope your week is going great!" followed by an incoming blue bubble reading "Mom that kit saved me today! Everyone on my floor wanted to use it." The phone is held at a gently elevated angle over a warm kitchen counter — adult hands visible wrapping around the sides, warm skin tones, no distinguishing face features. Soft bokeh background showing the corner of a kitchen counter with a ceramic mug of coffee, natural morning light through a window, warm domestic atmosphere. Warm golden-beige color temperature (#F5E6D3). Depth of field: phone screen and text bubbles are tack-sharp, background falls to smooth creamy blur. Below the phone, resting on the wooden kitchen counter surface slightly out of focus but clearly identifiable: a clean white PrepPack box with navy blue branding. At the bottom of the image, elegant thin sans-serif text in dark navy: "The text every parent wants to receive." Small badge below: "PrepPack - 100+ items - $100". Soft, warm, natural window light from the left. Eye-level camera angle, slightly above. Intimate, personal, editorial lifestyle photography in the style of premium DTC parent brands. Color palette: warm cream (#F5E6D3), warm navy (#1A2A4A), soft natural wood tones. Do not include: overly dramatic phone angle, dark backgrounds, clinical or cold color tones, any competitor brand boxes, text on the phone screen that is illegible or distorted, clearly identifiable faces, multiple phones. --ar 4:5

## CONCEPT 4 — Filename: Concept4_Campus_Health_Closes.png
**Score: 22/25 | Type: Pain Agitation**

Generate an image: Dramatic commercial photography with extreme visual contrast in a 4:5 vertical portrait format. The top half of the image: a stark, close-up of an institutional analog wall clock with the hands pointing to exactly 5:00, rendered in cold, clinical tones. The clock face is white with black numerals, mounted on a beige institutional wall. Behind the clock and slightly blurred: a corridor with a frosted glass door panel and a simple sign that reads "CLOSED". Cold, harsh fluorescent lighting. Color palette: cold clinical white (#F5F5F5), stainless chrome (#C0C8D0), institutional beige (#E8E4DC). Below a clean horizontal dividing line, the bottom half transitions completely: a warm, inviting dorm room desk scene under a soft amber desk lamp. The PrepPack box is open on the wooden desk, warmly lit (#F4A261 amber glow) — digital thermometer, Advil blister pack, cold medicine, and electrolyte powder stick pack visible and organized. The warm light wraps the items in a reassuring, hopeful glow. At the very top, large bold condensed white sans-serif: "CAMPUS HEALTH CLOSES AT 5." In the middle transition zone, medium-weight charcoal sans-serif: "Colds and fevers don't." At the bottom in clean cream sans-serif: "PrepPack is ready when they're not." Commercial photography with cinematic color contrast. Do not include: any identifiable real university names or logos, full human faces, standard red plastic first aid kits, emergency room or ambulance imagery, blood or injury, imagery suggesting serious medical emergency. --ar 4:5

Generate an image: Premium overhead flat-lay product photography of the PrepPack college preparedness kit on a warm cream linen surface, shot from directly above at 90 degrees. The PrepPack box — a clean, modern white premium box with navy blue PrepPack branding text — is positioned center of the frame, open with the lid propped against it. Radiating from the box in an organized, beautiful arrangement with intentional spacing between each group, four distinct clusters of items: Top-left cluster (First Aid): digital thermometer in black case, two blister packs of pain reliever, small tube of ointment, colorful bandage packets, alcohol wipe packets.

Bottom-right cluster (Comfort): teal-green compact fleece blanket folded, white earplugs in round case, navy blue sleep mask, deck of red playing cards, electrolyte powder stick pack. Soft, even, diffused warm studio light with gentle directional key light from upper-left. All items are tack-sharp. Surface is warm cream linen (#F9F3EC). Clean negative space between item groups. At the top 18% of the image, bold condensed navy sans-serif: "PEACE OF MIND. PACKED." (#1A2A4A). Below in lighter-weight sans-serif: "100+ items for everything they'll face." Bottom-right corner badge: "$100 - Free shipping". Premium editorial DTC aesthetic. Clean, warm, organized. Overhead flat-lay, 90-degree camera angle. Do not include: messy or chaotic arrangement, competing brand items, red cross symbols or clinical first aid box imagery, items that look cheap or plastic toy grade, promotional stickers from other brands. --ar 4:5
