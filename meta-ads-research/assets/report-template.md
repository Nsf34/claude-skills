## Executive Summary

[2-3 sentences: dominant angles found, most notable patterns, what this means strategically. Example below.]

> **Example**: Nova Ceramics runs 23 active ads, heavily concentrated on two angles: "stress relief through pottery" (11 ads) and "screen-free family activity" (7 ads). Their longest-running ad (147 days) is a UGC-style video targeting parents with a "rainy day rescue" hook. They've settled on a consistent "Free shipping + bonus clay" offer that appears in 15/23 ads, signaling high conversion confidence. The biggest gap in their coverage is the "gift" angle — only 1 ad targets gift-shoppers despite the product being highly giftable.
