# Creative Brief: [Competitor Name] Competitive Response

**Brand**: [Your brand name]
**Based on**: [Competitor Name] Ad Library Research — [Date]
**Concepts**: [Count]

## Priority Ranking

| # | Concept | Angle | Inspired By | Complexity | Priority |
|---|---------|-------|-------------|------------|----------|
| 1 | [Name] | [angle] | [What competitor insight or gap inspired this] | Quick win / Medium / Full shoot | HIGH |
| 2 | [Name] | [angle] | | | |
| 3 | [Name] | [angle] | | | |

> **Example**:
>
> | # | Concept | Angle | Inspired By | Complexity | Priority |
> |---|---------|-------|-------------|------------|----------|
> | 1 | Saturday Morning Studio | screen-free family activity | Nova Ceramics' "Rainy Day Rescue" — their top performer (147 days). We can own the broader "weekend ritual" version. | Quick win (repurpose existing family footage) | HIGH |
> | 2 | The Anti-Leak Test | leakproof commute | Nova's leak-test static got 3 variants — we have better ceramic lining and can do a live demo | Medium (shoot leak test) | HIGH |
> | 3 | Gift That Creates | memorable gift | Gap: Nova has only 1 gift ad. Holiday season is 8 weeks out — we can own this angle. | Medium (new footage needed) | MEDIUM |

## Concept 1: [Concept Name]

**Priority**: HIGH / MEDIUM / LOW
**Why this concept**: [1-2 sentences on the competitor insight or gap that makes this worth testing. Be specific — which competitor ad inspired it, what signal suggests the angle works, or what gap you're filling.]

### Creative Direction

| Field | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| **Angle** | [Core persuasion angle] |
| **Persona** | [Who this ad targets] |
| **Format** | Video (UGC-style) / Video (polished) / Static / Carousel |
| **Ratio** | 9:16 / 4:5 / 1:1 |
| **Funnel Stage** | TOF (awareness) / MOF (consideration) / BOF (decision) |

### Hook / Opening

> "[Exact hook text or opening line — what stops the scroll]"

**Visual**: [What the viewer sees in the first 1-3 seconds]

### Body Copy Direction

[2-3 sentences describing the message flow after the hook. This is directional guidance for what the ad communicates, not final copy. Think: hook → build tension → proof → offer → CTA.]

**Key points to hit:**
- [Point 1 — the main benefit or transformation]
- [Point 2 — the proof element]
- [Point 3 — the objection handle or CTA]

### Proof Elements Needed

| Proof Type | What to Capture/Source | Production Notes |
|------------|----------------------|-----------------|
| [demo / testimonial / stats / comparison / etc.] | [Specific footage, asset, or content needed] | [Any requirements — lighting, setting, talent] |

### Offer / CTA

- **Headline**: [What goes in the ad headline field]
- **CTA Button**: Shop Now / Order Now / Learn More
- **Offer**: [Discount / free shipping / bundle / none — with exact terms]

### Objection Addressed

- **Objection**: [The specific concern this ad preempts]
- **How it's handled**: [1 sentence — how the ad overcomes this doubt]

### Production Checklist

- [ ] [Asset/footage 1]
- [ ] [Asset/footage 2]
- [ ] [Copy finalized and reviewed]
- [ ] [Landing page aligned with ad messaging]

**Complexity**: Quick win (repurpose existing assets) / Medium (new footage needed) / Full shoot (scripted production)

> **Example — Concept 1: Saturday Morning Studio**
>
> **Priority**: HIGH
> **Why this concept**: Nova Ceramics' "Rainy Day Rescue" family is their top performer (4 variants, 147 days running, cross-platform). But they only frame pottery as a rain-day fallback. We can own the broader "weekend ritual" positioning — pottery as the thing families choose to do, not the thing they resort to.
>
> ### Creative Direction
> | Field | Detail |
> |-------|--------|
> | **Angle** | Screen-free family ritual (emotional + identity) |
> | **Persona** | Parents of kids 6-12 |
> | **Format** | Video (UGC-style, phone-shot aesthetic) |
> | **Ratio** | 9:16 (Reels/Stories primary) |
> | **Funnel Stage** | TOF |
>
> ### Hook / Opening
> > "This is what Saturday mornings look like at our house now."
>
> **Visual**: Phone-angle shot of kitchen table set up with pottery wheel, kid already working clay, coffee mug steaming in foreground. Feels casual, not produced.
>
> ### Body Copy Direction
> Open with the "Saturday morning" ritual framing → show the process (kid spinning clay, parent helping) → reveal the finished piece → "No screens. No arguments. Just creating together." → offer.
>
> **Key points to hit:**
> - Pottery as a chosen activity, not a last resort
> - Kid's pride in making something real
> - "Starter Bundle has everything you need"
>
> ### Proof Elements Needed
> | Proof Type | What to Capture/Source | Production Notes |
> |------------|----------------------|-----------------|
> | Demo | 15-sec clips of kid using wheel | Natural lighting, kitchen/dining table setting |
> | Outcome | Finished piece (painted mug or bowl) | Show kid holding it proudly |
> | Social proof | "Join 5,000+ families" text overlay | Use existing stat |
>
> ### Offer / CTA
> - **Headline**: Everything you need for family pottery night
> - **CTA**: Shop Now
> - **Offer**: Starter Bundle — free shipping + bonus clay pack
>
> ### Objection Addressed
> - **Objection**: "Too messy for my kitchen"
> - **How it's handled**: Brief shot of easy cleanup — clay wiping off table in 2 seconds
>
> ### Production Checklist
> - [ ] Film family pottery session (UGC-style, phone camera)
> - [ ] Capture kid's finished piece close-up
> - [ ] Record cleanup scene (5 seconds)
> - [ ] Write final caption copy
> - [ ] Align landing page hero with "family ritual" messaging
>
> **Complexity**: Quick win — can film with existing product and a willing family in one afternoon

## Competitor Angle Map

Shows which competitor patterns inspired each concept and whether you're filling a gap or directly competing:

| Concept | What Competitor Does | Your Twist | Gap or Direct Compete? |
|---------|---------------------|-----------|----------------------|
| [Concept 1] | [Their ad/angle] | [How you adapt or differentiate] | Gap / Direct |
| [Concept 2] | [N/A — they don't do this] | [Your original angle] | Gap |
| [Concept 3] | [Their approach] | [Your differentiation] | Direct |

> **Example**:
>
> | Concept | What Nova Does | Our Twist | Gap or Direct? |
> |---------|---------------|-----------|----------------|
> | Saturday Morning Studio | "Rainy Day Rescue" — pottery as weather fallback | Pottery as chosen weekend ritual, not last resort | Direct — better framing |
> | The Anti-Leak Test | Leak-test static with review screenshot | Live video demo with real bag + commute scenario | Direct — stronger proof |
> | Gift That Creates | Only 1 gift ad (holiday seasonal) | Year-round gift positioning for birthdays, thank-yous, teacher gifts | Gap — they barely cover this |

## Testing Plan

### Week 1 (Quick Wins)
- Launch Concept [X] — lowest production lift, test angle resonance first
- Launch Concept [Y] — repurpose existing footage with new hook copy

### Week 2-3 (Medium Lift)
- Produce Concept [Z] — requires new footage/assets
- A/B test hooks from Concepts [X] and [Y] based on Week 1 data

### Measurement
- **Primary**: CTR + CPA at ad level
- **Secondary**: Hook hold rate (3-second video views ÷ impressions)
- **Decision rule**: Kill after 3 days if CPA > 2× target. Scale if CPA < target after 500+ impressions.
- **Winner criteria**: Run winning ads for 2+ weeks before declaring a winner. Create variant families from proven angles.
