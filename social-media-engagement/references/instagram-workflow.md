# Instagram Workflow

This reference covers the full Instagram engagement workflow: discovery, qualifying, engagement actions, pacing, and safety.

## Discovery via Explore Tab

**Use the Explore tab** (compass icon in the sidebar), NOT the Search bar. The Explore page surfaces fresh, algorithmically relevant content every time, which means natural variety across sessions without repeating the same accounts. Searching by hashtag/name brings up the same results repeatedly and looks less organic.

### How to Browse Explore

1. Click the **Explore** icon (compass) in the left sidebar
2. Scroll through the grid and look for posts related to the brand's content themes (loaded from the brand context file)
3. When you spot a relevant post, click into it to see the account
4. Check the account against the qualifying criteria below
5. Before following, cross-check the account handle against the **engagement log** to avoid re-following accounts from previous sessions

### Additional Discovery Methods (mix in occasionally)

- **Suggested accounts:** When visiting a relevant profile, Instagram shows "Suggested for you" below the bio. These are great leads because they're algorithmically related.
- **Commenters on relevant posts:** People leaving thoughtful comments on niche content are often ideal target accounts. Click through to their profiles.
- **Competitor followers:** Occasionally browse who's following or commenting on competitor accounts (listed in the brand context file). Their followers are pre-qualified as interested in the niche.

Vary which discovery method is primary each session. Most sessions should lean on Explore, but mix in the others for variety.

## Qualifying an Account

Before following, check that the account meets **at least 3** of these criteria:

1. **Active:** Posted within the last 2 weeks
2. **Engaged audience:** Posts get real comments (not just emoji spam or bots)
3. **Relevant content:** Posts about topics matching the brand's content themes
4. **Real person or small brand:** Not a massive brand (50k+ followers). Focus on micro-creators, hobbyists, small businesses, and enthusiasts. The sweet spot is 500-20k followers.
5. **Target customer signal:** The account looks like someone who matches the brand's target customer profile (loaded from brand context)
6. **Not a bot:** Has a profile photo, bio, and genuine-looking post history

### Accounts to SKIP

- Obvious bot/spam accounts
- Accounts with 50k+ followers (they won't notice or reciprocate)
- Accounts that only post promotional/sales content
- Accounts in unrelated niches
- Private accounts (can't see their content to assess relevance)
- Accounts already in the engagement log for Instagram

## Engagement Actions

For each qualifying account:

1. **Follow the account**
2. **Like their most recent post** (or their best recent post if the latest isn't great)
3. **For 5 of the accounts:** Leave a genuine comment on their post (see `references/comment-guide.md` for writing rules)

The follow + like is the baseline for every account. Comments are reserved for posts where you have something genuinely specific to say. Don't force comments on posts that don't inspire a natural reaction.

## Session Limits

These limits are non-negotiable. Never exceed them in a single session.

| Action | Per Session | Daily Max (2 sessions) |
|--------|-------------|------------------------|
| Follows | 15 | 30 |
| Likes | 15 | 30 |
| Comments | 5 | 10 |

**Max 2 sessions per day** (morning + evening). Never run more than 2 Instagram sessions in a single day.

---

## Pacing

Instagram flags rapid-fire actions. Space out engagement to mimic natural behavior:

- **30-60 seconds** between follows
- **15-30 seconds** between likes
- **1-2 minutes** between comments
- If anything feels "off" (slow loading, repeated errors, unusual prompts), stop and tell the user

### Pattern Variation

Don't follow, like, comment in the exact same order every time. Mix it up:
- Sometimes like first, then follow
- Sometimes follow only (no like)
- Vary which accounts get comments (not always the first 5 or last 5)
- Occasionally scroll through a profile's recent posts and like 2-3 instead of just 1

The goal is to look like a real person casually browsing and engaging, not a bot executing a script.

## Safety and Stop Triggers

If you encounter ANY of these, **stop the session immediately** and inform the user:

- **"Action Blocked"** message
- **CAPTCHA** or phone verification request
- **Unusual loading times** or repeated errors
- **"Try Again Later"** message
- Any warning about **suspicious activity**
- Being **logged out** unexpectedly

**Cool-down after being flagged:** Wait at least **4-6 hours** before the next Instagram session. If flagged twice in one day, skip the rest of the day entirely.

Do not attempt to work around blocks or re-try flagged actions. Instagram's detection escalates with repeated violations.

## Time Per Session

A typical session takes **15-20 minutes** of browser work. Don't rush it. The pacing rules above naturally spread the session across this timeframe.
