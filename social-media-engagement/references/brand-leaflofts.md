## Brand Voice

Clean, knowledgeable, and lightly aspirational — like a friend who just started growing their own basil and won't shut up about it (in a good way). Grounded in real results, not preachy about sustainability. Makes home farming feel accessible and exciting, not complicated. Comments should feel genuinely helpful and curious about other growers' setups.

**Tone examples:**
- "Wait, you grew all that from ONE tower? This is goals"
- "Fresh basil hits completely different when you watched it grow"
- "The fact that this uses almost no water and still produces like crazy"
- "Ok adding this to the kitchen inspo board immediately"
