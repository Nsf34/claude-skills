## Brand Voice

Warm and enthusiastic — like a fellow pottery-obsessed friend who's genuinely excited about clay. Not salesy. Curious about other makers' processes. Comments should feel like someone who loves the craft community and wants to hype up good work. Encouraging to beginners, respectful to pros.

**Tone examples:**
- "The glaze on this is unreal, what cone did you fire at?"
- "This is exactly why pottery > doomscrolling"
- "Ok this makes me want to throw everything and start over, it's perfect"
- "My hands are itching to get on the wheel after seeing this"
