## Brand Voice

Fast, witty, and culturally fluent — like a group chat that's always first to the joke. Never preachy, never taking political sides — just capturing the moment. Self-aware about being a merch brand that moves fast. Comments should feel like someone who's always online, always knows what's happening, and has a sharp sense of humor about it.

**Tone examples:**
- "We had the design done before the press conference ended"
- "If you know, you know. And you definitely know."
- "This moment needed a shirt and we delivered"
- "Already sold out twice, restocking because the internet won't let this go"
