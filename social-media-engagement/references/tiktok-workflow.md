# TikTok Workflow

This reference covers the full TikTok engagement workflow: discovery, qualifying, engagement actions, pacing, and safety. TikTok is a video-first platform, so all engagement is with video content. Comments should reference what you saw or heard, not static images.

## Discovery Methods

TikTok's For You Page is the primary discovery mechanism, but five methods are available. Vary which method is primary each session for natural variety.

### 1. For You Page / FYP (primary method)

The FYP is TikTok's algorithmic feed. It surfaces fresh, relevant content every time you open the app, making it the best source of natural variety without repeating the same creators.

1. Open TikTok and land on the **For You** feed (default view)
2. Scroll through videos looking for content related to the brand's content themes (loaded from brand context file)
3. When you spot a relevant video, check the creator's profile against the qualifying criteria below
4. Before following, cross-check the creator's handle against the **engagement log** to avoid re-engaging
5. Move on if the content is from a massive creator or unrelated niche

This should be the primary method most sessions. The FYP provides variety without searching, which keeps engagement patterns organic.

### 2. Discover Tab

The Discover tab surfaces trending hashtags, sounds, and topics.

1. Tap the **Discover** (magnifying glass) icon
2. Browse trending hashtags and sounds in the brand's niche
3. Tap into relevant videos and evaluate the creators
4. Note that trending content may be from larger accounts, so qualifying is especially important here

### 3. Search

Search by keyword, hashtag, or username for niche content.

1. Use the search bar to look for keywords matching the brand's content themes (e.g., "pottery", "ceramic mug", "pour over coffee", "handmade crafts")
2. Browse video results and click into relevant content
3. Evaluate creators against qualifying criteria
4. Vary search terms across sessions to avoid repetitive patterns

### 4. Creator Profiles / Suggested Accounts

When visiting a relevant creator's profile, TikTok shows suggested accounts.

1. While on a qualifying creator's profile, look for the **suggested accounts** section (arrow icon near the Follow button, or below the bio)
2. Click through suggested creators and evaluate them
3. These are algorithmically related and often a great source of similar niche creators

### 5. Comment Sections

People commenting on relevant videos are often good engagement targets.

1. On a popular niche video, browse the comment section
2. Look for commenters who leave substantive comments (not just emoji)
3. Click through to their profiles and evaluate
4. People who write real comments are often engaged, active community members -- ideal targets

## Qualifying a Creator

Before following, check that the creator meets **at least 3** of these criteria:

1. **Active:** Posted within the last 2 weeks
2. **Engaged audience:** Videos get real comments (not just bot spam or generic emoji floods). Look for: multiple commenters, varied comment content, creator replies to comments.
3. **Relevant content:** Posts videos about topics matching the brand's content themes. Check the first **5-10 videos** on their profile, not just the most recent one -- TikTok creators sometimes go viral with off-brand content.
4. **Right size:** 500-30,000 followers. Below 500 may be too new or inactive. Above 30k is unlikely to notice or reciprocate. The sweet spot is **1,000-15,000 followers**. Note: TikTok follower counts are often lower than Instagram equivalents for comparable influence, because the FYP algorithm amplifies reach far beyond a creator's followers.
5. **Target customer signal:** The creator looks like someone who matches the brand's target customer profile (loaded from brand context)
6. **Not a bot:** Has a profile photo, bio, and genuine-looking video history. Watch for: accounts that only repost others' content (common on TikTok), accounts with zero original videos, and accounts with suspiciously uniform engagement patterns.

### Creators to SKIP

- Obvious bot/spam accounts or repost-only accounts
- Creators with 30k+ followers (unlikely to notice or reciprocate)
- Creators who only post promotional/sales/affiliate content
- Creators in unrelated niches
- Private accounts (can't see their content)
- Accounts already in the engagement log for TikTok

---

## Engagement Actions

For each qualifying creator:

1. **Follow the creator**
2. **Like (heart) their most recent video** (or their best recent video if the latest isn't a good fit)
3. **For 4 of the creators:** Leave a genuine comment on their video (see `references/comment-guide.md` for writing rules)

The follow + like is the baseline for every creator. Comments are reserved for videos where you have something genuinely specific to say about what you saw or heard. Don't force comments on videos that don't inspire a natural reaction.

No saves/bookmarks (too low-signal), no shares (not engagement), no duets or stitches (those are content creation, not engagement).

## Session Limits

Conservative limits. TikTok is aggressive about bot detection, especially for newer accounts. These limits are intentionally lower than Instagram's to account for TikTok's stricter enforcement.

| Action | Per Session | Daily Max (2 sessions) |
|--------|-------------|------------------------|
| Follows | 10 | 20 |
| Likes | 12 | 24 |
| Comments | 4 | 8 |

**Max 2 sessions per day** (morning + evening). Never run more than 2 TikTok sessions in a single day.

These limits are conservative by design. Reports indicate TikTok flags at around 30-50 follows per day, but setting session limits at 10 provides a comfortable margin, especially for accounts that are not yet established on TikTok.

For accounts that have been running TikTok engagement for 2+ weeks without any flags, the user could consider gradually increasing to 12 follows per session. But this should be a manual decision by the user, not automatic.

---

## Pacing

Space out every action to mimic natural browsing behavior:

- **45-90 seconds** between follows
- **20-40 seconds** between likes
- **2-3 minutes** between comments
- When doing multiple actions on a single creator (follow + like + comment), space individual actions by **15-30 seconds**

### Watch Before Engaging

**This is critical and unique to TikTok:** Always watch at least **10-15 seconds** of a video before engaging with it. TikTok tracks watch time as a signal. An account that follows, likes, or comments without actually watching videos is a strong bot indicator.

Do not immediately follow/like/comment the moment a video loads. Let the video play, then engage. This adds natural time to the session and makes behavior more organic.

### Pattern Variation

Don't follow, like, comment in the same order every time. Mix it up:
- Sometimes like first, then follow
- Sometimes follow only (no like)
- Vary which creators get comments (not always the first or last ones)
- Occasionally scroll through a creator's recent videos and like 2-3 instead of just 1
- Sometimes just watch and scroll past without engaging -- not every relevant video needs an action

The goal is to look like a real person naturally browsing their FYP and occasionally engaging with content they enjoy.

## Safety and Stop Triggers

If you encounter **ANY** of these, **stop the session immediately** and inform the user:

- **"You're tapping too fast"** or any rate-limiting message
- **CAPTCHA** or verification request
- **Phone number verification** prompt
- **"This account was banned"** or any account restriction notice
- **"Your comment couldn't be posted"** on repeated attempts
- **Unusual loading times** or repeated errors
- Being **logged out** unexpectedly
- Any message about **suspicious activity** or **community guidelines** violation

### Shadowban Awareness

TikTok may shadowban accounts without any explicit notification. A shadowban means the account's content is suppressed -- videos get near-zero views, content doesn't appear in hashtag searches, and FYP distribution drops dramatically.

Shadowban indicators (the user would need to report these -- they're not visible during an engagement session):
- The brand's own videos suddenly getting near-zero views
- Content not appearing under hashtag searches
- Dramatic drop in engagement on the brand's own posts

**If a shadowban is suspected:** Pause all TikTok engagement for **48-72 hours**. Do not attempt to engage through it. Shadowbans typically lift on their own after a few days of normal (non-aggressive) activity.

### Cool-Down Protocols

- **After being flagged:** Wait at least **6-12 hours** before the next TikTok session
- **Flagged twice in one day:** Skip the rest of the day entirely
- **Suspected shadowban:** Pause for **48-72 hours**
- **After a temporary ban lifts:** Run at **half limits** for the first 2 sessions back

TikTok's penalties escalate quickly: rate-limit warning, then temporary action block (minutes to hours), then temporary account ban (24 hours), then permanent ban. Each step happens faster with repeated violations. This is why conservative limits matter.

## URL Structure

When logging engagement, use full URLs:

- **Creator profiles:** `https://www.tiktok.com/@username`
- **Videos:** `https://www.tiktok.com/@username/video/[video_id]`

If the URL contains tracking parameters (like `?is_from_webapp=1`), log the clean URL without them.

---

## Time Per Session

A typical TikTok session takes **15-25 minutes** of browser work. The pacing rules and the watch-time requirement (10-15 seconds per video before engaging) naturally spread actions across this timeframe. Don't rush.
