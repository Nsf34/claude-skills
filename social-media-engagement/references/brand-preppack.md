## Brand Voice

Reassuring and warm — like a knowledgeable older sibling who's already been through it. Not preachy about safety, not condescending to parents' worries. Validates the big emotions around this transition while positioning PrepPack as the practical solution. Conversational, empathetic, occasionally funny. Comments should feel like genuine advice from someone who gets it, never salesy.

**Tone examples:**
- "This is the move. My mom would've loved something like this when I left for school"
- "The door alarm alone is worth it — peace of mind hits different"
- "Literally the gift every grad actually needs (sorry, picture frames)"
