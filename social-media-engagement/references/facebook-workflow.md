# Facebook Workflow

This reference covers the full Facebook engagement workflow for a **Business Page** account. All actions are performed as the Page (not a personal profile), so there are no friend requests. Engagement happens through Page follows, reactions, comments, and Group participation.

## Discovery Methods

Facebook doesn't have an Explore tab like Instagram. Discovery uses five methods. Vary which method is primary each session for natural variety.

### 1. News Feed Suggested Content (primary method)

1. Scroll the main News Feed looking for **"Suggested for you"** posts
2. Look for content related to the brand's content themes (loaded from brand context file)
3. Click through to the poster's Page to evaluate
4. If the poster is a personal profile, check whether they also have a Page (many creators do)
5. Move on if the content is from a massive brand or unrelated niche

This is the easiest method because Facebook surfaces suggestions automatically. Use it as the primary discovery path in most sessions.

### 2. Facebook Groups (highest-value method)

Groups are where niche communities live on Facebook. They're the best source of engaged, relevant accounts.

**Joining new groups:**
- Search for groups related to the brand's content themes (e.g., "pottery community", "ceramics beginners", "handmade craft lovers", "coffee enthusiasts")
- Evaluate groups against the qualifying criteria below before joining
- Limit: **1-2 new group joins per session**
- When joining, Facebook may ask "Why do you want to join?" -- answer naturally and briefly as the brand

**Engaging within groups you've already joined:**
- Browse recent posts in groups you're already a member of
- React to posts that match the brand's niche
- Leave comments on posts where you have something specific to say (see `references/comment-guide.md`)
- Look at who's posting quality content -- visit their profile/Page as a discovery lead

### 3. Suggested Pages

- Facebook surfaces **"Pages You May Like"** in the sidebar and in the Feed
- Look for small Pages in the brand's niche
- Follow relevant Pages and engage with their recent posts
- Also check the **"Discover"** section under the Pages tab in the left sidebar

### 4. Comments on Relevant Page Posts

- Browse popular Pages in the brand's niche
- Look at who is leaving thoughtful, substantive comments on their posts
- Click through to those commenters' profiles/Pages
- People who write real comments (not just emojis) are often ideal engagement targets -- they're active, engaged, and interested in the niche

### 5. Related Pages

- When visiting a relevant Page, Facebook shows **"Related Pages"** in the right sidebar or below the Page info
- These are algorithmically related and often a great source of similar small businesses and creators
- Click through and evaluate against qualifying criteria

## Qualifying Criteria

Different criteria apply depending on the account type.

### For Pages (follow candidates)

Before following a Page, check that it meets **at least 3** of these:

1. **Active:** Posted within the last 2 weeks
2. **Relevant content:** Posts about topics matching the brand's content themes
3. **Genuine engagement:** Posts get real comments from followers, not just like counts or bot responses
4. **Right size:** 200-50,000 followers. Below 200 may be inactive. Above 50k is too large to notice or reciprocate.
5. **Not a massive brand or corporation:** Focus on small businesses, independent creators, hobbyists, community Pages
6. **Not already followed:** Check the engagement log

### For Groups (join candidates)

Before joining a Group, check that it meets **at least 3** of these:

1. **Active community:** New posts at least weekly, ideally multiple times per week
2. **Relevant topic:** Matches the brand's content themes
3. **Decent moderation:** Not overrun with spam, sales posts, or irrelevant content
4. **Right size:** 500-50,000 members. Below 500 may be too quiet. Above 50k tends to be noisy and impersonal.
5. **Public or approval-required:** Avoid closed/secret groups that look exclusive or invite-only

**Limit:** Join only 1-2 new groups per session. You don't want to trigger Facebook's spam detection by joining too many groups at once.

### Accounts to SKIP

- Obvious fake, bot, or spam Pages
- Pages with 50,000+ followers (too large to notice engagement)
- Pages in unrelated niches
- Inactive Pages or Groups (no posts in 30+ days)
- Pages/Groups with controversial, political, or divisive content
- Accounts already in the engagement log for Facebook

---

## Engagement Actions (as a Business Page)

For each qualifying account or piece of content:

### 1. Follow Other Pages

- Click **Like** or **Follow** on their Page
- This is the Facebook equivalent of an Instagram follow
- Only follow Pages, not personal profiles (Business Pages can't send friend requests)

### 2. React to Posts

Use contextually appropriate reactions:

| Reaction | When to Use | Frequency |
|----------|-------------|-----------|
| **Like** (thumbs up) | Safe default for any post | ~50% of reactions |
| **Love** (heart) | Beautiful finished pieces, aesthetic content, stunning photos, inspiring work | ~40% of reactions |
| **Care** (hug) | Personal stories, struggles, milestones, someone sharing their first piece | ~10% of reactions |

**Never use:** Haha, Wow, Sad, or Angry. These are too easy to misread as mocking or sarcastic coming from a brand Page. If unsure, default to Like.

### 3. Comment on Posts (as the Page)

- **4 comments per session** (see `references/comment-guide.md` for writing rules)
- Comments appear as the brand Page name, so they represent the brand publicly
- Prioritize commenting on posts where you have something genuinely specific to say
- In Groups, comments are especially valuable because they build the Page's presence as a contributing community member

### 4. Group Participation

- Join relevant groups (1-2 new per session max)
- React to posts within groups you've already joined
- Comment on group posts where appropriate
- Be a contributing member, not a lurker or spammer
- Never post promotional content about the brand in groups -- only react and comment authentically on others' posts

## Session Limits

Conservative limits. Facebook penalizes Business Pages more aggressively than personal profiles for suspicious activity.

| Action | Per Session | Daily Max (2 sessions) |
|--------|-------------|------------------------|
| Page follows | 8 | 16 |
| Reactions | 12 | 24 |
| Comments | 4 | 8 |
| Group joins | 1-2 | 2-3 |

**Max 2 sessions per day.** Space sessions at least 4 hours apart.

These limits are intentionally conservative. Facebook's rate-limiting thresholds for Business Pages are not well-documented and can vary. It's better to do less and stay safe than to push limits and get restricted.

---

## Pacing

Space out every action to mimic natural browsing behavior:

- **45-90 seconds** between Page follows
- **20-40 seconds** between reactions
- **1-3 minutes** between comments
- **5+ minutes** between group joins
- When doing multiple actions on a single account (follow + react + comment), space the individual actions by **15-30 seconds**

Vary the order of actions. Don't always follow, then react, then comment in the same sequence.

---

## Safety and Stop Triggers

If you encounter **ANY** of these, **stop the session immediately** and inform the user:

- **"This Feature is Temporarily Unavailable"**
- **"You're Going Too Fast"** or **"Slow Down"**
- **Account checkpoint** or identity verification request
- **CAPTCHA**
- **"Your Account Has Been Restricted"**
- **Phone number verification** prompt
- **"Something Went Wrong"** on repeated actions
- Unexpected **redirect to a help/support page**
- Being **logged out** unexpectedly
- Any message suggesting the account has been **flagged or limited**

**Cool-down after being flagged:** Wait at least **6-12 hours** before the next Facebook session. This is longer than Instagram because Facebook penalties escalate more aggressively. A Business Page restriction can last 7-30 days, so err on the side of caution.

Do not attempt to work around restrictions or re-try flagged actions.

## URL Structure

When logging engagement, use full URLs:

- **Pages:** `https://www.facebook.com/[pagename]`
- **Posts:** `https://www.facebook.com/[pagename]/posts/[post_id]` or `https://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=[id]`
- **Groups:** `https://www.facebook.com/groups/[group_id_or_name]`
- **Group posts:** `https://www.facebook.com/groups/[group_id]/posts/[post_id]`

If a URL contains a numeric profile ID instead of a username (e.g., `profile.php?id=12345`), log the numeric URL as-is.

---

## Time Per Session

A typical Facebook session takes **15-25 minutes** of browser work. The pacing rules naturally spread actions across this timeframe. Don't rush.
