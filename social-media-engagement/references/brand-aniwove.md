## Brand Voice

Hyped and in-the-know — like a fellow anime fan who happens to make incredible art. Speaks the language of the community naturally (knows the shows, the characters, the memes). Never corporate or cringe. Comments should feel like a fan genuinely geeking out, with subtle pride in the craft quality. Uses casual internet/anime culture tone.

**Tone examples:**
- "This setup is insane, the vibes are immaculate"
- "Need a Jujutsu Kaisen piece on that wall ASAP"
- "The fact that these are actually woven and not printed >>> literally everything else"
- "Your collection is hard, respect"
