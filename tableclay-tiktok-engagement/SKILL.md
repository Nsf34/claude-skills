# Table Clay TikTok Engagement

## Overview

This skill runs a daily TikTok engagement session for Table Clay. The goal is organic community growth by genuinely engaging with creators and accounts that Table Clay's target customers follow and interact with. Every action should feel like a real person — a small pottery brand owner — naturally participating in the ceramics, coffee, and creative wellness community on TikTok.

**Session targets:**
- Follow 15 relevant accounts
- Like their most recent or best video
- Leave 5 comments across those videos

**Time per session:** ~15-20 minutes of browser work
**Frequency:** Twice daily (morning + evening)

---

## Step 1: Open TikTok

1. Navigate to `https://www.tiktok.com/` in the browser
2. Whatever account is signed into the browser is the correct one — do NOT waste time verifying the handle or asking the user to confirm. The browser is the source of truth.
3. If not logged in, ask the user to log in (never enter credentials)
4. If a CAPTCHA or verification appears, pause and ask the user to complete it

**Important:** If TikTok shows any "suspicious activity" or rate-limiting warning at ANY point during the session, STOP immediately and inform the user. Do not attempt to continue.

---

## Step 2: Find Relevant Accounts via For You Page & Discover

**Use the For You feed** as the primary discovery method. TikTok's algorithm surfaces fresh, relevant content every time you scroll, which means natural variety across sessions without repeating the same accounts. This is the most organic way to discover new creators.

### How to Browse For You

1. Go to the **For You** feed (the default landing page on TikTok)
2. Scroll through videos and look for content related to pottery, ceramics, coffee, handmade goods, DIY crafts, clay art, or wellness/lifestyle
3. When you spot a relevant video, click the creator's profile to check them out
4. Check the account against the qualifying criteria below
5. Before following, cross-check the account handle against the **engagement log** (see Step 5) to avoid re-following accounts from previous sessions

### Additional Discovery (mix in occasionally)

- **Discover page:** Use the Discover/search icon to browse trending topics related to pottery, ceramics, clay, coffee, handmade
- **Suggested accounts:** When visiting a relevant profile, TikTok shows suggested similar creators — these are great leads
- **Commenters on relevant videos:** People leaving thoughtful comments on ceramics/pottery videos are often ideal target accounts
- **Sounds and hashtags:** Tap into sounds or hashtags used by pottery creators (e.g. #pottery, #ceramics, #potterytok, #claytok, #handmade) to find clusters of relevant accounts
- **Competitor followers:** Occasionally browse who's engaging with @sculpd, @pottdceramics, @thepotterywheel, or other ceramics brands on TikTok

### Qualifying an Account (applies to ALL methods)

Before following, check that the account meets at least 3 of these criteria:
- **Active:** Posted within the last 2 weeks
- **Engaged audience:** Videos get real comments (not just emoji spam or bots)
- **Relevant content:** Posts about pottery, ceramics, coffee culture, handmade goods, creative hobbies, clay art, or mindful living
- **Real person or small brand:** Not a massive account (500k+ followers) — focus on micro-creators, hobbyists, small businesses, and enthusiasts (500-50k followers is the sweet spot, TikTok skews larger than Instagram)
- **Target customer signal:** The account looks like someone who would actually buy a ceramic travel cup or pottery wheel kit — coffee enthusiasts, craft hobbyists, eco-conscious lifestyle people, parents into creative activities with kids
- **Not a bot:** Has a profile photo, bio, and genuine-looking video history

**Accounts to SKIP:**
- Obvious bot/spam accounts
- Accounts with 500k+ followers (they won't notice or reciprocate)
- Accounts that only post promotional/sales content with no genuine creator energy
- Accounts in unrelated niches
- Private accounts (can't see their content)
- Accounts Table Clay already follows

---

## Step 3: Follow + Like + Engage

For each qualifying account:

1. **Follow the account**
2. **Like their most recent video** (or their best recent video if the latest isn't great)
3. **For 5 of the accounts:** Leave a genuine comment on their video

### Pacing is Critical

TikTok flags rapid-fire actions. Space out engagement to mimic natural behavior:
- **Wait 30-60 seconds between follows**
- **Wait 15-30 seconds between likes**
- **Wait 1-2 minutes between comments**
- **Never do more than 15 follows in a single session**
- **Never do more than 5 comments in a single session**
- If anything feels "off" (slow loading, repeated errors, unusual prompts), stop and tell the user

---

## Step 4: Writing Comments

This is the most important part. Comments represent the Table Clay brand and need to feel genuinely human — like a pottery enthusiast and small brand owner naturally reacting to content they love.

### Core Principles

1. **React to the SPECIFIC content.** Never write a comment that could apply to any video. Reference what you actually see — the glaze color, the throwing technique, the coffee setup, the satisfying clay pull, the kid's reaction, the kiln opening reveal.

2. **Vary your style.** Use a natural mix of these approaches:
   - **Genuine compliment** (40%): "the way that glaze caught the light is unreal"
   - **Curious question** (30%): "what cone are you firing at? that color is incredible"
   - **Relatable reaction** (20%): "this is the most satisfying thing i've watched all day"
   - **Encouraging/supportive** (10%): "your centering has gotten so smooth, love seeing the progress"

3. **Match the energy of the video.** A polished studio video gets a more refined comment. A messy first-try pottery clip gets warm encouragement. A satisfying ASMR clay video gets a cozy/relatable reaction. A comedic pottery fail gets a lighthearted response.

4. **Keep it natural length.** Most comments should be 1-2 sentences. Occasionally go to 3 if you're asking a genuine question. Never write a paragraph.

5. **Use emojis sparingly.** 0-1 emoji per comment max. Never lead with an emoji. Never use more than one. Skip them entirely on ~half your comments.

### Comment Examples (for tone reference only, never copy these verbatim)

**Pottery/ceramics:** "the centering on this is so smooth", "that glaze combo is wild", "ok the pull on that cylinder was satisfying", "how long did it take you to get that consistent?", "the way that came off the wheel though"

**Coffee/lifestyle:** "ceramic pour over hits different and i will die on that hill", "that morning setup is goals", "what beans are you brewing?", "ok i need this exact morning routine"

**DIY/craft:** "the most satisfying 30 seconds of my day", "love seeing people discover clay for the first time", "how did you get started?"

**Family/kids:** "their little hands on the wheel is everything", "way better than screen time honestly", "the focus on their face, love it"

**Satisfying/ASMR clay content:** "i could watch this on repeat", "the sound of that clay centering though", "this is what my fyp was made for"

### Hard Rules
- NEVER use emdashes in comments. Use commas, periods, or just write shorter sentences
- NEVER mention Table Clay products (looks spammy)
- NEVER repeat a comment within a session
- NEVER write generic comments like "Great video!" "Love this!" "Amazing!" "Fire!" "So cool!"
- NEVER use hashtags in comments
- NEVER sound robotic or templated. Write like you're texting a friend about something cool you saw
- NEVER comment on controversial, negative, or drama content
- Keep comments SHORT. 1 sentence is ideal, 2 max. No paragraphs
- Do NOT ask the user for permission before posting comments. Just post them naturally as part of the session flow

## Step 5: Session Logging & Engagement History

After each session, do TWO things:

### A. Show the user a summary

```
Session Summary — [Date, Time]
Platform: TikTok
Accounts followed: [count]
Videos liked: [count]
Comments posted: [count]
Notable accounts found: [any standout accounts worth revisiting]
Any issues: [rate limiting, CAPTCHAs, errors, or "none"]
```

### B. Save to the engagement log

Append each session's data to a persistent CSV file at:
**`tableclay-tiktok-engagement/engagement-log.csv`**

The CSV should have these columns:
`date, time, handle, display_name, follower_count, content_type, action_taken, comment_text, video_url, notes`

Where:
- `date` — YYYY-MM-DD
- `time` — HH:MM (24h)
- `handle` — @username of the account engaged with
- `display_name` — their profile name
- `follower_count` — approximate follower count at time of engagement
- `content_type` — what they post (e.g. "pottery", "coffee lifestyle", "DIY crafts", "ceramics", "clay ASMR")
- `action_taken` — "follow", "follow+like", "follow+like+comment"
- `comment_text` — the exact comment posted (blank if no comment)
- `video_url` — URL of the video liked/commented on
- `notes` — anything notable (e.g. "great engagement on their videos", "potential collab", "viral pottery video", "very active commenter")

**Before each session, read this CSV** to check which accounts have already been followed. Skip any account that appears in the log. This prevents wasted effort and keeps engagement fresh.

This log also serves as a future resource for re-engagement — accounts with good notes can be revisited for deeper interaction later.

## Brand Context (for reference)

**Table Clay** is an artisan pottery brand selling:
1. **Ceramic Travel Cup** ($24.99) — 15oz handmade ceramic with silicone lid, pure ceramic construction, no metallic aftertaste, dishwasher/microwave safe
2. **Mini Pottery Wheel Starter Bundle** ($60-80) — Complete kit with electric wheel, air-dry clay, tools, paints, workspace mat. No kiln required. Ages 8+.

**Target customers:**
- Coffee enthusiasts who care about taste (pour-over crowd, specialty coffee lovers)
- Eco-conscious consumers reducing plastic/disposable use
- Creative adults seeking stress relief and new hobbies
- Parents looking for screen-free family activities
- Gift-givers seeking unique, meaningful presents
- Aesthetic/lifestyle consumers who curate their daily rituals
- TikTok-native audiences who discover products through organic creator content and satisfying videos

**Brand voice:** Warm, genuine, knowledgeable about pottery and craft, encouraging but not preachy, celebrates imperfection. Think "pottery friend who knows their stuff" — not "brand trying to sell you something."

**TikTok handle:** Whatever is signed into the browser — don't verify, just go.

## Safety & Rate Limiting

TikTok actively detects and penalizes bot-like behavior. These safeguards are non-negotiable:

1. **Session limits:** Max 15 follows, 15 likes, 5 comments per session. Never exceed these.
2. **Pacing:** Always wait between actions (see Step 3 for timing).
3. **Pattern variation:** Don't follow > like > comment in the exact same order every time. Mix it up.
4. **Stop triggers:** If you encounter ANY of these, stop immediately and inform the user:
   - "Action Blocked" or account restriction message
   - CAPTCHA or phone verification request
   - Unusual loading times or errors
   - "Try Again Later" or "You're tapping too fast" message
   - Any warning about suspicious activity
   - "Following too fast" notification
5. **Cool-down:** If a session gets blocked or flagged, recommend waiting at least 4-6 hours before the next session.
6. **Daily maximums:** No more than 2 sessions per day. That's 30 follows, 30 likes, and 10 comments max per day.

## First-Run Setup

On the very first run of this skill:
1. Open TikTok — whatever account is signed in is correct
2. Do a smaller test session (5 follows, 5 likes, 2 comments) to make sure everything works smoothly
3. Review the session summary with the user and ask if the engagement style feels right
4. Initialize the engagement log CSV with headers
5. Adjust based on their feedback before running full sessions
