| 1 | Ceramic Taste Test | `leakproof_commute` + pure taste (new) | Nova's core "taste" angle — unproven on camera by any competitor | Quick win | HIGH |

## Concept 1: Ceramic Taste Test

**Priority**: HIGH
**Why this concept**: Nova Ceramics' single most powerful differentiator is "coffee tastes better in ceramic." They claim it everywhere — brand story, About page, product descriptions — but they never PROVE it on camera. Table Clay can own this proof point by filming a blind taste test. Whoever proves it first wins the angle.

### Creative Direction

| Field | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| **Angle** | `leakproof_commute` + "pure taste" (propose adding to taxonomy) |
| **Product** | `travel_mug` |
| **Persona** | `coffee_commuter`, `coffee_person` |
| **Format** | Video (UGC-style) |
| **Ratio** | 9x16 |
| **Funnel Stage** | tof |

### Hook / Opening

> "We gave 10 people the same coffee in 3 different mugs. Every single one picked THIS one."

**Visual**: Close-up of three identical coffees in plastic, stainless steel, and ceramic travel mugs. Participant sips each, then points to ceramic with surprised expression.

### Body Copy Direction

After the hook, show a quick montage of 3-5 people doing the taste test — sipping from each, reacting, consistently choosing ceramic. End with the Table Clay mug reveal and a quick feature rundown (handmade, dishwasher safe, fits cupholder). The message: it's not just beautiful, it genuinely makes your coffee taste better.

**Key benefit points:**
- Pure ceramic taste — no metallic or plastic aftertaste
- Handmade by real artisans (not factory-stamped)
- Practical for daily commute (lid, heat band, cupholder-friendly)

### Proof Elements Needed

| Proof Type | What to Capture | Notes |
|------------|----------------|-------|
| Demo | Blind taste test with 5-10 participants | Film in casual setting (kitchen, office). Real reactions only |
| Social proof | Include participant quotes: "This one, 100%" | Get verbal reactions on camera |
| Specs | Quick end-card: ceramic, 1400°C fired, dishwasher safe | 2-3 second feature flash |

### Offer / CTA

- **Headline**: "Your Coffee Deserves Ceramic"
- **CTA Button**: Shop now
- **Offer**: Free shipping + 10% off first order

### Objection Addressed

- **Objection**: `fragile`
- **How it's handled**: Brief shot of mug in car cupholder / bag — "Built for your commute, not your shelf"

### Production Checklist

- [ ] 3 identical coffees + 3 mug types (plastic travel, stainless steel, Table Clay ceramic)
- [ ] 5-10 participants for taste test (friends, family, local café customers)
- [ ] Camera setup for reactions (phone is fine — UGC aesthetic)
- [ ] Table Clay mug beauty shot for reveal moment
- [ ] End-card with offer (10% off + free shipping)

**Estimated complexity**: Quick win (repurpose existing product, film in a day)

## Concept 2: "You MADE That?!" Beginner Reveal

**Priority**: HIGH
**Why this concept**: Nova Ceramics only sells finished drinkware. They cannot compete in the "maker" space. Table Clay's mini pottery wheel is an entirely uncontested product category on Meta — and the making process is inherently more engaging, shareable content than holding a mug. The "reveal" format (beautiful piece → reveal it was made by a total beginner) exploits the disbelief gap.

### Creative Direction

| Field | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| **Angle** | `beginner_confidence` |
| **Product** | `mini_wheel` |
| **Persona** | `beginner_maker`, `parent`, `gift_seeker` |
| **Format** | Video (UGC-style) |
| **Ratio** | 9x16 |
| **Funnel Stage** | tof |

### Hook / Opening

> [Camera on beautiful, glazed ceramic piece] "My friend made this. She's never touched clay before."

**Visual**: Close-up of a polished, impressive finished piece. Slow rotation to show the glaze detail. Then CUT TO: the friend sitting at a Table Clay mini wheel, laughing, covered in a tiny bit of clay, shaping the same piece.

### Body Copy Direction

Lean into the disbelief moment — "Wait, a BEGINNER made that?" Then show a compressed journey: unboxing the mini wheel, first wobbly attempt, hands on clay, the satisfying centering moment, and the finished piece. End with the friend holding it up proudly. The message: you don't need to be an artist. You just need to start.

**Key benefit points:**
- Complete beginner → beautiful piece in one session
- Everything included in the kit (wheel, clay, tools)
- Compact enough for any apartment or kitchen table

### Proof Elements Needed

| Proof Type | What to Capture | Notes |
|------------|----------------|-------|
| Demo | Full journey: unbox → first attempt → finished piece | Speed up the process, keep under 30 seconds |
| Outcome | Close-up of finished piece (beautiful enough to trigger "I want to make that") | This is the hero shot — must look genuinely impressive |
| Objection kill | Show compact setup + easy cleanup | 2-3 second insert: wipe down, store away |

### Offer / CTA

- **Headline**: "Your First Piece Is Waiting"
- **CTA Button**: Shop now
- **Offer**: Starter Bundle + free shipping

### Objection Addressed

- **Objection**: `learning_curve`
- **How it's handled**: The entire ad IS the objection kill — a beginner made something beautiful on their first try

### Production Checklist

- [ ] One willing "beginner" participant (genuinely never used a wheel)
- [ ] Table Clay mini wheel kit (unboxed on camera)
- [ ] Film the full session (compress to 20-30 seconds)
- [ ] Close-up hero shot of finished piece
- [ ] Quick cleanup shot (wipe, store)
- [ ] End-card with Starter Bundle offer

**Estimated complexity**: Medium (need to film a real beginner session, but no script required — the authentic messiness IS the content)

---

## Concept 3: Creator Code Program Launch

**Priority**: HIGH
**Why this concept**: Nova Ceramics runs 13+ active influencer codes, confirming that paid UGC at scale works in this category. Table Clay has a massive advantage: the mini wheel creates PROCESS content (throwing, glazing, finishing) that is inherently more engaging than product-holding content. Recruit 10-15 creators who align with Table Clay's personas and give them product + unique codes.

### Creative Direction

| Field | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| **Angle** | `handmade_aesthetic`, `pottery_therapy`, `screen_free_family` |
| **Product** | `mini_wheel`, `travel_mug`, `aesthetic_mugs` |
| **Persona** | All — each creator targets a different persona |
| **Format** | Video (paid UGC) |
| **Ratio** | 9x16 |
| **Funnel Stage** | tof / mof |

### Hook / Opening

> [Varies by creator — examples:]
> "I tried pottery for the first time and I'm obsessed" (beginner_maker)
> "Screen-free Saturday with the kids" (parent)
> "This is my new stress relief" (apartment_adult)

**Visual**: Creator's authentic first-person experience with the product. Each creator's natural style and audience dictates the hook.

### Body Copy Direction

Each creator produces 2-3 pieces of content: an initial reaction/unboxing, a "making" session, and a finished piece reveal. Table Clay whitelists the best-performing content as paid ads. The creator's unique code (e.g., SARAH10, MAKERWITH10) drives trackable conversions.

**Key benefit points:**
- Authentic creator endorsement (not scripted)
- Different angles tested simultaneously across creator audiences
- Trackable ROI per creator via unique codes

### Proof Elements Needed

| Proof Type | What to Capture | Notes |
|------------|----------------|-------|
| UGC | Creator's genuine first experience with product | Ship product, provide loose brief, let them create naturally |
| Social proof | "X followers tried it because of [creator]" — future retargeting | Track code usage for social proof in future ads |
| Demo | Creator using the product (throwing clay, drinking from mug) | Process content for wheel; lifestyle content for mugs |

### Offer / CTA

- **Headline**: Varies by creator
- **CTA Button**: Shop now
- **Offer**: Creator-specific 10% code + free shipping

### Objection Addressed

- **Objection**: Various — each creator naturally addresses a different one
- **How it's handled**: Beginner creators kill `learning_curve`; parent creators kill `mess`; apartment creators kill `space`

### Production Checklist

- [ ] Identify 10-15 creators across Table Clay personas (micro-influencers, 5K-50K followers)
- [ ] Create creator brief with loose guidelines (not scripts)
- [ ] Ship product kits to each creator
- [ ] Generate unique promo codes per creator
- [ ] Set up whitelisting/spark ads infrastructure on Meta
- [ ] Review and approve content before running as ads

**Estimated complexity**: Medium (logistics of recruiting + shipping, but creators produce the content)

## Concept 4: Morning Ritual Elevation

**Priority**: MEDIUM
**Why this concept**: Nova uses "upgrade your routine" as a secondary message. Table Clay can make it the PRIMARY message for aesthetic mugs — but with a twist: the mug wasn't just chosen, it was MADE (or at least handmade by artisans). The craft story elevates a routine product pitch into something with soul.

### Creative Direction

| Field | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| **Angle** | `morning_ritual` |
| **Product** | `aesthetic_mugs` / `travel_mug` |
| **Persona** | `aesthetic_home`, `coffee_person` |
| **Format** | Video (polished lifestyle) |
| **Ratio** | 4x5 (Feed) + 9x16 (Stories) |
| **Funnel Stage** | tof |

### Hook / Opening

> [Slow-motion pour into a beautiful Table Clay mug, steam rising, morning light]
> Text overlay: "Some mornings just hit different."

**Visual**: ASMR-quality morning coffee sequence. Natural light, cozy kitchen, steam, the satisfying sound of coffee pouring into ceramic. The mug is the star — the glaze catches the light.

### Body Copy Direction

Minimal copy — let the visuals do the work. The sequence: alarm off → kitchen → grind beans → pour into beautiful ceramic mug → first sip → subtle smile → text overlay with product name and offer. The message: small upgrades to your daily ritual make everything better.

**Key benefit points:**
- Handmade ceramics elevate the everyday
- Each mug is unique — yours is one of a kind
- Microwave safe for reheating (practical touch)

### Proof Elements Needed

| Proof Type | What to Capture | Notes |
|------------|----------------|-------|
| Lifestyle | Beautiful morning coffee sequence | Needs good lighting and a visually appealing kitchen/space |
| Demo | Coffee pouring into mug (ASMR-quality audio) | The pour IS the proof — ceramic sounds and looks premium |

### Offer / CTA

- **Headline**: "Elevate Your Morning"
- **CTA Button**: Shop now
- **Offer**: Free shipping + browse the collection

### Objection Addressed

- **Objection**: `price`
- **How it's handled**: The cinematic quality communicates premium value — "worth it" is felt, not said

### Production Checklist

- [ ] Select 2-3 hero mugs for filming (best glazes for camera)
- [ ] Morning light kitchen setup (natural light preferred)
- [ ] Coffee making supplies (pour-over or espresso for visual appeal)
- [ ] Macro lens or good phone for close-up glaze detail
- [ ] ASMR-quality audio recording of pour

**Estimated complexity**: Quick win (single morning shoot, 1-2 hours)

## Concept 5: "One Mug. Zero Waste." Sustainability Lead

**Priority**: MEDIUM
**Why this concept**: Nova Ceramics mentions sustainability throughout their brand but never leads an ad with it. The eco-conscious consumer segment is growing fast, and "sustainable" is baked into the ceramics/handmade value proposition naturally. Table Clay can own this angle aggressively — especially by contrasting handmade ceramic with disposable cups and mass-produced drinkware.

### Creative Direction

| Field | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| **Angle** | `handmade_aesthetic` + sustainability (propose adding `eco_craft` to taxonomy) |
| **Product** | `travel_mug` |
| **Persona** | `coffee_commuter`, `apartment_adult` |
| **Format** | Video (brand manifesto style) |
| **Ratio** | 9x16 |
| **Funnel Stage** | tof |

### Hook / Opening

> [Stack of disposable coffee cups, growing taller] "Americans throw away 50 billion cups a year."
> [Hand reaches in, replaces the stack with one beautiful ceramic mug] "You only need one."

**Visual**: The contrast between waste (tower of disposable cups) and intention (one handmade ceramic mug) creates an immediate emotional reaction. The swap is the hook.

### Body Copy Direction

After the hook, briefly show the mug being handmade (glazing, firing — the craft). Then show it in daily use: morning coffee, car commute, office desk, evening tea. The message: one beautiful, handmade mug replaces thousands of disposable cups — and it's better in every way.

**Key benefit points:**
- One reusable ceramic mug replaces thousands of disposable cups
- Handmade with care, not factory-stamped
- Toxin-free, food-safe materials (better for you AND the planet)

### Proof Elements Needed

| Proof Type | What to Capture | Notes |
|------------|----------------|-------|
| Stats | "50 billion disposable cups per year" (or verified stat) | Verify exact stat before publishing |
| Demo | Mug in daily use across multiple settings | Quick cuts: kitchen, car, office, couch |
| Specs | "Toxin-free glazes, BPA-free silicone, durable stoneware" | End-card bullet points |

### Offer / CTA

- **Headline**: "One Mug. Zero Waste. Pure Craft."
- **CTA Button**: Shop now
- **Offer**: Free shipping + 10% off

### Objection Addressed

- **Objection**: `fragile`
- **How it's handled**: Show the mug surviving daily use — tossed in a bag, bumped on a desk — "built to last years, not days"

### Production Checklist

- [ ] Stack of disposable cups for visual contrast
- [ ] Table Clay travel mug as hero product
- [ ] Multiple daily-use locations for quick cuts (kitchen, car, office)
- [ ] Fact-check disposable cup waste stat
- [ ] End-card with sustainability message + offer

**Estimated complexity**: Quick win (one shoot day, simple props)

## Competitor Angle Map

| Concept | Competitor Did This | Table Clay's Twist | Gap or Direct Compete? |
|---------|--------------------|--------------------|----------------------|
| Ceramic Taste Test | Nova claims "pure taste" but never proves it on camera | Table Clay PROVES it with a blind taste test — own the evidence | Direct — but with stronger proof |
| "You MADE That?!" Reveal | N/A — Nova only sells finished products | Table Clay sells the EXPERIENCE of creating, not just consuming | Gap (uncontested) |
| Creator Code Program | Nova runs 13+ influencer codes for UGC at scale | Table Clay recruits maker/craft creators — process content is more engaging than product-holding | Direct — but with differentiated content type |
| Morning Ritual Elevation | Nova uses "upgrade your routine" as secondary message | Table Clay makes it primary + adds the "handmade story" layer | Direct — with deeper narrative |
| Sustainability Lead | Nova mentions sustainability but never leads with it | Table Clay makes it the hero angle — "one mug, zero waste" | Gap (unowned by competitor) |

---

## Testing Plan

### Week 1 (Quick Wins)
- Launch **Concept 1 (Ceramic Taste Test)** — film in one day, edit in one day. Test the "pure taste" angle with actual proof before Nova does it
- Launch **Concept 4 (Morning Ritual)** — repurpose any existing product footage with new copy direction
- Launch **Concept 5 (Sustainability Lead)** — simple props, powerful contrast visual

### Week 2-3 (Medium Lift)
- Produce **Concept 2 ("You MADE That?!" Reveal)** — requires a real beginner session. Film, compress, launch
- Begin **Concept 3 (Creator Program)** outreach — identify 10 creators, ship kits, set timeline for content delivery

### Week 3-4 (Scale)
- A/B test hooks from Concepts 1 and 5 based on Week 1 CTR data
- Review first creator content submissions from Concept 3
- Whitelist top-performing creator content as paid ads

### Measurement
- **Primary metric**: CTR + CPA at ad level
- **Secondary**: Hook hold rate (3-second video views / impressions)
- **Decision rule**: Kill after 3 days if CPA > 2x target; scale if CPA < target
- **Track**: Which angles drive lowest CPA — taste test, maker reveal, ritual, or sustainability
