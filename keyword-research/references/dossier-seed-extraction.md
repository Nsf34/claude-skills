# Dossier Seed Extraction Guide

The product-research dossier is the best starting point for keyword research because it contains the exact language your target audience uses. Customers describe their problems, motivations, and objections in their own words — and those words are what they type into Google.

This guide explains how to systematically mine each dossier section for seed keywords.

## What Makes a Good Seed Keyword

A seed keyword is a starting term that gets expanded into a cluster of related keywords. Good seeds are:

- **Specific enough** to represent a real search query (not just "pottery")
- **Broad enough** to have related variations (not "Table Clay Mini Pottery Wheel 2024 edition")
- **In customer language** (not marketing jargon — "beginner pottery kit" not "ceramic arts starter solution")
- **Actionable** — you can imagine someone typing this into Google with a clear intent

## Section-by-Section Extraction

### S3: Market Landscape Overview → Category & Alternative Keywords

This section lists 5-8 product categories and alternative solutions. These become **category-level seed keywords** — the broadest, highest-volume terms.

**What to extract:**
- Product category names (e.g., "pottery wheel," "craft kits for adults," "experience gifts")
- Alternative solutions mentioned (e.g., "pottery classes," "clay sculpting kits," "DIY craft subscriptions")
- Needs-to-category mappings (e.g., "stress relief hobbies," "screen-free activities for families")

**Keyword patterns to generate:**
```
[category name]                        → "pottery wheel"
best [category] [year]                 → "best pottery wheel 2025"
[category] for [audience]              → "pottery wheel for beginners"
[alternative] vs [product category]    → "pottery classes vs pottery kit"
[need] [category]                      → "stress relief craft kits"
```

**Typical yield:** 8-15 seed keywords from S3.

### S4: Competitor & Offer Teardown → Comparison & Alternative Keywords

This section contains 8-12 competitor names, their products, and positioning. These become **comparison and alternative keywords** — high-intent, decision-stage queries.

**What to extract:**
- Competitor brand names (e.g., "Sculpd," "ClayMakers," "MudWorks")
- Competitor product names (e.g., "Sculpd Home Pottery Kit")
- Positioning statements (key phrases competitors use to describe themselves)
- Competitive gaps (things competitors don't offer — these become differentiation keywords)

**Keyword patterns to generate:**
```
[competitor] vs [competitor]           → "Sculpd vs ClayMakers"
[competitor] alternative               → "Sculpd alternative"
[competitor] review                    → "Sculpd pottery kit review"
[your product] vs [competitor]         → "Table Clay vs Sculpd"
best [category] not [competitor flaw]  → "pottery kit that includes tools"
```

**Typical yield:** 10-20 seed keywords from S4.

**Important:** Comparison keywords ("X vs Y") have high commercial intent. Searchers are actively deciding between options. These map directly to Comparison Post blog types.

### S5: Voice of Customer Analysis → Customer Language Keywords

This is the richest section for seed keywords. It contains the exact words customers use to describe their motivations, pain points, and experiences.

**What to extract from Motivations:**
- Phrases customers use to describe why they bought (e.g., "stress relief," "something creative to do," "quality time with kids")
- Emotional descriptors (e.g., "relaxing hobby," "meditative," "satisfying")
- Use-case descriptions (e.g., "date night at home," "retirement gift," "birthday activity")

**Keyword patterns from motivations:**
```
[emotional descriptor] [category]     → "relaxing hobbies for adults"
[use case] [category]                 → "date night pottery kit"
[motivation phrase] ideas             → "creative gift ideas for mom"
best [category] for [motivation]      → "best craft kit for stress relief"
```

**What to extract from Objections:**
- Concerns phrased as questions (e.g., "is it messy," "too hard for beginners," "waste of money")
- Problem descriptions (e.g., "no artistic talent," "limited space," "not enough time")

**Keyword patterns from objections:**
```
is [product/category] [objection]     → "is pottery messy"
[category] for [objection rebuttal]   → "pottery wheel for small spaces"
can you [category] with [limitation]  → "can you do pottery without a kiln"
[category] worth it                   → "is a pottery wheel worth it"
```

**What to extract from VoC Themed Quotes:**
- Recurring phrases across multiple quotes (if 5 customers say "therapeutic," that's a search term)
- Specific product attributes customers mention (e.g., "quiet motor," "easy to clean," "comes with everything")

**Keyword patterns from quotes:**
```
[recurring phrase] [category]         → "therapeutic crafts for adults"
[product attribute] [category]        → "quiet pottery wheel"
[category] that [attribute]           → "pottery kit that comes with everything"
```

**Typical yield:** 15-30 seed keywords from S5. This section alone often produces more seeds than all other sections combined.

### S6: Objection Kill Sheet → Problem-Focused Keywords

The 12-15 objections in customer words become **FAQ-style and problem-focused keywords**. People search their concerns before buying.

**What to extract:**
- Each objection phrased as a search query
- The root cause of each objection (often contains a more specific keyword)

**Keyword patterns:**
```
[objection as question]               → "is pottery hard to learn"
[category] [objection word]           → "pottery wheel noise level"
how to [overcome objection]           → "how to do pottery without making a mess"
[category] for [non-obvious audience] → "pottery for people with no talent"
do you need [prerequisite]            → "do you need a kiln for pottery"
```

**Typical yield:** 8-15 seed keywords from S6.

**Blog mapping note:** These keywords map directly to FAQ/Myth-Busting and Problem-Solution post types.

### S7: Contextual Positioning → Occasion & Context Keywords

If present, this section provides occasion-specific and contextual angles (gift, seasonal, professional use).

**What to extract:**
- Occasion names (e.g., "Mother's Day," "Christmas," "birthday")
- Context frames (e.g., "gift for," "activity for," "party idea")
- Specific hooks mentioned (e.g., "last-minute gift," "unique gift," "experience gift")

**Keyword patterns:**
```
[occasion] gift [category]            → "Christmas pottery gift"
best [category] gift for [recipient]  → "best craft gift for mom"
unique [occasion] gift ideas          → "unique birthday gift ideas for her"
[context] [category]                  → "pottery party activity"
```

**Typical yield:** 5-10 seed keywords from S7 (if section exists).

### S8: Persona-Specific Positioning → Audience Keywords

Personas reveal how different audiences search for the same product category.

**What to extract:**
- Audience descriptors (e.g., "busy parents," "retirees," "young couples")
- Persona-specific needs (e.g., "screen-free family activity," "hobby for empty nesters")
- Channel preferences (where each persona looks for information — this hints at search behavior)

**Keyword patterns:**
```
[category] for [persona descriptor]   → "crafts for busy moms"
best [category] for [age/life stage]  → "best hobbies for retirees"
[persona need] ideas                  → "screen-free family activity ideas"
[category] [persona context]          → "pottery wheel for apartment"
```

**Typical yield:** 5-10 seed keywords from S8.

### S9: Messaging Hierarchy & Ad Angles → Validated Demand Keywords

Ad angles represent messaging that has been (or is designed to be) tested with real audiences. The hooks and promises often contain keyword-rich language.

**What to extract:**
- Hook phrases (the first thing viewers see — often mirrors search queries)
- Core promises (benefit statements that match commercial intent searches)
- Angle names and concepts (thematic groupings that map to content topics)

**Keyword patterns:**
```
[hook phrase]                         → "pottery at home" (from "Pottery Therapy at Home" angle)
[core promise as search]              → "learn pottery without classes"
[angle concept] [category]            → "pottery for mental health"
```

**Typical yield:** 5-10 seed keywords from S9.

### S10: Pricing & Bundling → Value & Comparison Keywords

Pricing data generates searches around value assessment.

**What to extract:**
- Price ranges and tier names
- Value comparison language
- Bundle descriptions

**Keyword patterns:**
```
[category] under $[price]             → "pottery wheel under $100"
cheap vs expensive [category]         → "cheap vs expensive pottery kits"
[category] price comparison           → "pottery kit price comparison"
is [product] worth $[price]           → "is a pottery kit worth $80"
```

**Typical yield:** 3-5 seed keywords from S10.

## Organizing the Seed List

After extracting from all available sections, organize seeds into groups:

1. **Category terms** (from S3) — broadest, highest potential volume
2. **Comparison terms** (from S4) — highest purchase intent
3. **Customer language terms** (from S5) — most authentic, often long-tail
4. **Problem/objection terms** (from S6) — FAQ and problem-solution content
5. **Occasion/context terms** (from S7) — seasonal and gift content
6. **Audience terms** (from S8) — persona-targeted content
7. **Validated hooks** (from S9) — pre-tested messaging as keywords
8. **Value terms** (from S10) — price-conscious searchers

Deduplicate across groups. Many seeds will overlap (e.g., an objection from S6 and a VoC quote from S5 might produce the same keyword). Keep the most specific version.

**Target: 15-25 unique seed keywords** to carry into the web search expansion phase. More than 25 becomes unwieldy; fewer than 15 may miss important clusters.

## When No Dossier Is Available

If the user doesn't have a product-research dossier yet, fall back to:

1. **Product name + category** as the primary seed (e.g., "mini pottery wheel," "at-home pottery kit")
2. **User-provided seed keywords** if any
3. **Quick web research** to identify 2-3 competitors and extract their positioning language from their websites
4. **Suggest running the product-research skill first** — the dossier dramatically improves keyword research quality. A 15-minute detour to build a dossier will produce better keywords than hours of blind searching.
